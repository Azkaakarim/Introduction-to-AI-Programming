## Lab 4: Define Your Own Function  

This folder contains the lab work for **Lab 4**, focusing on creating and using Python functions to solve engineering and AI-related tasks.

### Topics Covered
- Defining and calling user-defined functions  
- Using positional, keyword, default, *args, and **kwargs arguments  
- Function annotations and docstrings  
- Performing calculations such as series and parallel resistance, Ohm’s Law, and solar inverter data  
- File handling with function outputs (optional)  

### Objective
To develop practical skills in designing and using Python functions, handling different types of arguments, documenting code with docstrings, applying annotations, and performing computational tasks relevant to engineering and AI applications.
