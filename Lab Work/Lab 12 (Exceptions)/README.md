# Lab 12: Exception Handling

This folder contains the lab work for **Lab 12**, focusing on **Python exception handling** and its practical applications.

## Topics Covered
- Handling **TypeError** (e.g., adding int and string)
- Handling **ZeroDivisionError**
- Handling **IndexError** (list index out of range)
- Detecting **logical errors** using `raise`
- Handling **assertion failures** using `assert` and `AssertionError`
- Using **try, except, else, finally** blocks for robust program execution

## Objective
To strengthen understanding of **Python exception handling** by applying it to real-world scenarios. Students learn to **identify errors, handle exceptions, and ensure program reliability**, building foundational skills for writing robust and user-friendly Python programs in engineering and AI-related applications.
