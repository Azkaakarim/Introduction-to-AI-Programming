## Lab 8: Lambda Function  

This folder contains the lab work for **Lab 8**, focusing on Python lambda functions and their practical applications.

### Topics Covered
- Creating basic lambda functions  
- Lambda with multiple arguments and keyword-only arguments  
- Using lambda with `map()`, `filter()`, `sorted()`, and `reduce()`  
- Replacing small `def` functions with lambdas  
- Sorting lists, tuples, and dictionaries using lambda and `operator.itemgetter`  
- Conditional lambda functions for classification  
- Transforming, filtering, and aggregating data concisely  

### Objective
To learn how to write concise, Pythonic one-line functions using lambdas, and apply them with built-in functions for quick transformations, filtering, sorting, and calculations in engineering and AI-related tasks.
