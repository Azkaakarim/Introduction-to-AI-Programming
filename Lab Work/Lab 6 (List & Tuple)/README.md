## Lab 6: List and Tuple  

This folder contains the lab work for **Lab 6**, focusing on Python lists and tuples for effective data storage and manipulation.

### Topics Covered
- Python lists: creation, access, update, slicing  
- Nested and heterogeneous lists  
- List mutator methods: append, extend, insert, remove, pop  
- Operators and built-in functions on lists: `in`, `+`, `*`, `len()`, `min()`, `max()`, `sum()`  
- List comprehensions and conversion from tuples  
- Tuples: creation, single element nuance, indexing, slicing  
- Nested tuples and mutable items  
- Packing and unpacking tuples  
- Choosing between tuples and lists for fixed vs mutable data  
- Operators and built-in functions with tuples  

### Objective
To gain practical skills in organizing, modifying, and processing structured data using Python lists and tuples, enabling efficient handling of student records, inventory systems, and configuration data in engineering and AI applications.
