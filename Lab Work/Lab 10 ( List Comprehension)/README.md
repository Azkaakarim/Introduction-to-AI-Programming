## Lab 10: List Comprehension 

This folder contains the lab work for **Lab 10**, focusing on Python list comprehensions and their practical applications.

### Topics Covered
- Filtering list elements based on conditions  
- Transforming list elements with arithmetic operations  
- Selecting and processing specific items (e.g., even numbers, strings starting with a character)  
- Using conditional expressions inside list comprehensions  
- Generating sequences and multiples using `range()` and comprehensions  

### Objective
To strengthen understanding of Python list comprehensions by applying them to real-world engineering and AI-related data. Students learn to filter, transform, and generate lists efficiently, building foundational skills for writing clean, concise, and optimized code in AI programming and data handling.
