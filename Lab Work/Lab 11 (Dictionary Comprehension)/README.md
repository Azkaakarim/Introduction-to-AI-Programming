## Lab 11: Dictionary Comprehension  

This folder contains the lab work for **Lab 11**, focusing on Python dictionary comprehensions and their practical applications.

### Topics Covered
- Creating dictionaries from lists using `zip()`  
- Conditional value assignment in dictionaries (e.g., “Low”/“High”)  
- Performing calculations and storing results in dictionaries  
- Converting dictionary values using formulas (e.g., °C → °F)  
- Enumerating items to create index-based dictionaries  
- Filtering dictionaries based on value conditions  

### Objective
To develop strong skills in Python dictionary comprehensions for efficient data mapping, filtering, and transformation. Students learn to create and manipulate dictionaries in a clean, optimized, and Pythonic way, which is essential for handling structured data in engineering and AI programming.
