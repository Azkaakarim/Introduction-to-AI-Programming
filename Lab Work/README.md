# Lab Work – Introduction to AI Programming  

This repository contains all lab work for the **Introduction to AI Programming** course, covering Labs 1 through 13. Each lab focuses on different Python programming concepts, applied to engineering and AI-related tasks, to help students develop practical programming skills and a strong foundation in data handling.

## Folder Structure
- `Lab1_Introduction/` – Getting started with Python: Hello World, print statements, variables, data types, and basic input/output  
- `Lab2_Basics/` – Introduction to Python basics, data types, and simple operations  
- `Lab3_Conditional/` – Conditional statements and decision-making in Python  
- `Lab4_Functions/` – Functions, arguments, return values, and modular programming  
- `Lab5_FrequentlyUsedMethods/` – Built-in Python methods for data handling (enumerate, zip, map, filter, sorted, reversed, range, any, all, type, len, sum, min, max, abs, round, divmod, pow)  
- `Lab6_ListAndTuple/` – Working with lists and tuples, indexing, slicing, mutator methods, comprehensions, packing/unpacking, and conversions  
- `Lab7_Dictionary/` – Dictionaries, nested dictionaries, accessing, updating, deleting entries, and using built-in methods  
- `Lab8_LambdaFunctions/` – Lambda functions, anonymous functions, map/filter/reduce, and using lambda for sorting and conditional operations  
- `Lab9_Loops/` – For loops, while loops, iterations, simulations, and real-world applications  
- `Lab10_ListComprehension/` – List comprehensions for filtering, transformations, and sequence generation  
- `Lab11_DictionaryComprehension/` – Dictionary comprehensions, conditional assignments, calculations, indexing, and filtering  
- `Lab12_ExceptionHandling/` – Exception handling in Python: try/except blocks, raising exceptions, handling assertion errors, and ensuring robust program execution  
- `Lab13_ReadingAndWriting/` – Reading and writing CSV/text files: recording energy consumption, solar generation, maintenance logs, student audits, electricity billing, fault events, and organizing processed data  

## Topics Covered in Lab 13
- Recording **hourly load demand** in a CSV file  
- Logging **daily solar energy generation** and appending new records  
- Maintaining **transformer maintenance logs** in text files  
- Storing **student energy audit data** in CSV format  
- Creating and appending **monthly electricity billing records**  
- Recording **substation fault events**  
- Reading CSV data line by line, **counting records**, and displaying formatted output  
- Writing **processed and organized data** to a new CSV file without overwriting the original  

## Purpose
The labs aim to provide hands-on experience in Python programming for engineering and AI applications. Students learn to:
- Organize, store, and process data efficiently using Python file handling  
- Maintain consistent data formats for analysis and reporting  
- Append new data safely without overwriting previous records  
- Strengthen problem-solving skills for AI programming, energy monitoring, and data analysis  

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the lab folder of interest (e.g., `Lab1_Introduction/` or `Lab13_ReadingAndWriting/`)  
2. Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script for that lab  
3. Run each cell or code block to understand the examples  
4. Modify examples or add your own code to explore concepts further  

This collection serves as a comprehensive reference for fundamental Python skills in AI programming and related engineering tasks.
