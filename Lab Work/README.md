# Lab Work – Introduction to AI Programming  

This repository contains all lab work for the **Introduction to AI Programming** course, covering Labs 1 through 11. Each lab focuses on different Python programming concepts, applied to engineering and AI-related tasks, to help students develop practical programming skills and a strong foundation in data handling.

## Folder Structure
- `Lab1_Introduction/` – Getting started with Python: Hello World, print statements, variables, data types, and basic input/output  
- `Lab2_Basics/` – Introduction to Python basics, data types, and simple operations  
- `Lab3_Conditional/` – Conditional statements and decision-making in Python  
- `Lab4_Functions/` – Functions, arguments, return values, and modular programming  
- `Lab5_FrequentlyUsedMethods/` – Built-in Python methods for data handling (enumerate, zip, map, filter, sorted, reversed, range, any, all, type, len, sum, min, max, abs, round, divmod, pow)  
- `Lab6_ListAndTuple/` – Working with lists and tuples, indexing, slicing, mutator methods, comprehensions, packing/unpacking, and conversions  
- `Lab7_Dictionary/` – Dictionaries, nested dictionaries, accessing, updating, deleting entries, and using built-in methods  
- `Lab8_LambdaFunctions/` – Lambda functions, anonymous functions, map/filter/reduce, and using lambda for sorting and conditional operations  
- `Lab9_Loops/` – For loops, while loops, iterations, simulations, and real-world applications  
- `Lab10_ListComprehension/` – List comprehensions for filtering, transformations, and sequence generation  
- `Lab11_DictionaryComprehension/` – Dictionary comprehensions, conditional assignments, calculations, indexing, and filtering  

## Purpose
The labs aim to provide hands-on experience in Python programming for engineering and AI applications. Students learn to:
- Organize and manipulate data efficiently using Python structures  
- Apply calculations, transformations, and filters to real-world datasets  
- Build clean, concise, and optimized code using comprehensions and lambda functions  
- Strengthen problem-solving skills for AI programming and data analysis  

## How to Use
1. Navigate to the lab folder of interest (e.g., `Lab1_Introduction/` or `Lab6_ListAndTuple/`)  
2. Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script for that lab  
3. Run each cell or code block to understand the examples  
4. Modify examples or add your own code to explore concepts further  

This collection serves as a comprehensive reference for fundamental Python skills in AI programming and related engineering tasks.
