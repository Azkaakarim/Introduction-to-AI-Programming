## Lab 9: Loops  

This folder contains the lab work for **Lab 9**, focusing on Python loops and their practical applications.

### Topics Covered
- Using `for` loops to iterate through lists and ranges  
- Using `while` loops for conditional iteration  
- Performing calculations inside loops (e.g., I², doubling values, halving values)  
- Generating sequences such as serial numbers or timers  
- Simulating real-world processes: battery charging, countdown timers, power doubling, cycle and motor speed control  
- Loop control and conditional execution  

### Objective
To develop practical skills in using Python loops for data iteration, calculation, simulation, and automation in engineering and AI contexts, including handling sensor readings, energy data, serial number generation, and process simulations.
