# Lab 2 – Basic Python Data Types & File Handling

This lab focuses on **fundamental Python data types** and their application in engineering computations. Through practical exercises, I learned to work with **numbers, strings, complex numbers, CSV files, and directories**, while applying Python to **real-world electrical engineering scenarios**.

## Key Concepts Practiced
- **String formatting:** Using `%`, `.format()`, and f-strings for clear, professional output.  
- **File handling:** Reading CSV files, performing calculations, and manipulating numeric and string data.  
- **Numbers and complex arithmetic:** Representing impedances with complex numbers, calculating magnitude, phase, and total impedance.  
- **Circuit analysis:** Computing current, voltage, AC power, and efficiency using Python.  
- **Bit operations:** Checking parity of binary signals.  
- **Directory operations:** Counting and validating file types (e.g., PDF reports).  

## Objective
The lab aims to strengthen **Python programming skills** for engineering applications, helping to **automate calculations, analyze data, and generate reports** efficiently and accurately.
