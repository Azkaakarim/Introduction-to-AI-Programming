## Complex Engineering Problem (CEP)  

This folder contains the **Complex Engineering Problem (CEP)** project developed as part of the *Introduction to AI Programming* course. The project focuses on analyzing building-level energy consumption, solar PV generation, and electricity cost using real-world data.

### Project Overview
The project utilizes the **CityLearn 2022 dataset**, specifically:
- `building_2` dataset for energy and solar data  
- Electricity price dataset for cost analysis  

The analysis involves processing time-series data to evaluate:
- Electricity consumption  
- Solar photovoltaic (PV) generation  
- Net energy usage  
- Electricity cost with and without PV integration  

### Key Tasks
- Load building and price CSV files  
- Extract non-shiftable electrical load and compute net consumption  
- Process solar generation data and convert it to usable energy units  
- Calculate electricity bills without PV  
- Compute net consumption after PV integration  
- Identify surplus (exportable or storable) energy  
- Perform cost and energy summation analysis  
- Visualize and interpret results clearly  

### Analysis and Visualization
The project includes clear visualizations to support interpretation of:
- Energy consumption patterns  
- Solar generation impact  
- Net electricity usage  
- Cost comparison with and without PV  

### Constraints
- Only concepts covered in the course are used  
- Emphasis on clean logic, correctness, and clarity  

### Evaluation Criteria
- Code Quality and Organization: Clean structure, meaningful variable names, and logical flow  
- Code Correctness: Accurate implementation of all required tasks and error-free execution  

### Objective
To apply introductory AI programming concepts to a realistic energy engineering problem, demonstrating data handling, computational thinking, and analytical skills.
